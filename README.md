# Latency measurement with automatic hosts discovery #
## Project created as an assignment for *Computer networks* course ##

### Task ###
The purpose of this assignment is to write program `latency`, which will be measuring latency between computers using UDP, TCP and ICMP protocol. Program should automatically discover other computers which enable latency measurement and within given time interval measure the latency to all these computers.

Program should also enable discovering other computers in local network using mDNS protocol.

User should also have the possibility to connect to User Interface using telnet.

To sum up, program `latency` should be:

* server for measurement by UDP protocol,

* client for measurement by all three protocols,

* mDNS server,

* mDNS client,

* User Interface server.

### Grade ###
For this assignment I have achieved the highest possible grade (6.0/6.0).
